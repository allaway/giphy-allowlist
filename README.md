# giphy-allowlist

A GIPHY allowlist/whitelist to pair with a pan-facebook blocklist such as [Developer Dan's Facebook blocklist](https://blocklist-tools.developerdan.com/blocklists/ce9c6ec5-13b5-4018-90e2-462b999362c2). This allowlist contains GIPHY domains, with the exception of known cookie/analytics domains. Facebook has been ordered to sell GIPHY, so it's possible that this allowlist will eventually become obsolete if/when the pan-Facebook blocklists no longer include GIPHY domains.
